<h1>Silver Medal Human Practices</h1>
<p>iGEM teams are leading in the area of Human Practices because they conduct their projects within a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.</p>
<p>Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest. </p>
<p>For more information, please see the <a href="http://2017.igem.org/Competition/Human_Practices">Human Practices page</a>.</p>

				<h2>Part I: All you need is LOV: Expanding the synthetic biology toolbox using LacILOV</h2>

				<h3>LacILOV:</h3>

				<p>LacILOV is a novel, photoactive fusion protein of the LacI repressor DNA binding domain from the lactose operon of E. coli and the Light Oxygen Voltage (LOV)-Sensing domain from Avena sativa (oats) [1]. The LOV domain is derived from asLOV2 and activated in the presence of blue light through a flavin mononucleotide (FMN). FMN transfers energy to a catalytic cysteine and induces a conformational change in the protein. In the absence of light, it is hypothesized that LacILOV behaves much like the lac repressor, dimerizing and binding to the lacO promoter sequence, Ptrc-2. However, in the presence of light, specifically of wavelength 465 nm [2], the repressor monomerizes and no longer blocks the promoter site allowing RNA polymerase to start transcription.</p>

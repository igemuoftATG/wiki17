				<h2 class="text-cyan">Ethics Workshop</h2>
				<p>After the coding portion of the day, students participated in 5 team activities designed to give students an understanding of our CRISPR/Cas9 project, the technical and ethical challenges of gene editing, and various synthetic biology topics.</p>
				<p>The Python station reinforced concepts taught earlier on, while an RNA folding puzzle game was a platform for introducing basic mechanisms behind CRISPR and the idea of the “open laboratory,” or collaboration with the public as a method to tackle difficult challenges such as CRISPR off-target effects. In addition, a hands-on genetic circuit activity illustrated the mechanisms behind gene expression and feedback loops, which was followed by ethical case studies that provided an opportunity to discuss different perspectives and understand the societal effects of advancements in gene editing technology.</p>
 				<p> Mentors were available at each station to provide guidance, but students had to work together to solve each challenge in order to gain points. In particular, students performed well in the two case studies regarding gene drives and gene editing in Down’s syndrome patients, generating thoughtful answers in response to our discussion questions about the environmental, moral, and social impact of these potential applications of CRISPR technology. The winning team received 3D printed commemorative plaques to celebrate their success and enthusiasm in synthetic biology.</p>

				<h2 class="text-cyan">Engagement</h2>
				<p>Upon students’ reflections on their experiences at the workshop, many reported that they had learned new information regarding bioinformatics, genetics, the ethical considerations of gene editing, as well as university programs. In addition, a student remarked that one of their key takeaways from the workshop was “learning about the real world applications of topics they had learned in school.” Students also commented that they found the introduction to bioinformatics and group activities engaging and informative for their future career choices. It was rewarding to see a high level of engagement in our students, and we hope to have inspired the next generation of synthetic biologists, scientists and engineers to see the world in a different way.</p>

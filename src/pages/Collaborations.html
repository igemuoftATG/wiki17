				<h2></h2>

				<p>A sincere thank you to all the iGEM teams that helped us out by providing development points, feedback, and a diverse range of voices (literally) to our project. We hope working with us was as fulfilling and uplifting as it was for our team working with all of you!</p>

				<h2>Wet Lab</h2>
				<h3>iGEM UBC</h3>
				<p>We incorporated their sgRNA into the final switch of our CRISPR/Cas9 system to better minimize off target hits and provided experimental data to help validate their model. They shared the results of energy released by our original sgRNA using their model.</p>

				<h2>Dry Lab</h2>
				<h3>iGEM Waterloo</h3>
				<p> We featured them on our podcast and talked about their project. They hosted the oGEM (Ontario iGEM) meetup, and afterwards we formed a multi-team Slack channel to provide each other with advice and feedback regarding our projects. We also improved a wiki generator developed by iGEM Toronto previously. The new version of the generator is capable of handling wiki updates from any team in a centralized server.</p>

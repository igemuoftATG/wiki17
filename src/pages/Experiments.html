			<hr><h3><a id="70_Ethanol_Protocol_starter_pack_1"></a>70% Ethanol Protocol (starter pack)</h3>
			<h4><a id="Introduction_2"></a>Introduction</h4>
			<p>Ethanol is a commonly used antiseptic in the lab environment. It has the highest effective concentration at 70% compared to a stronger solution. This occurs due to alcohol’s ability to coagulate protein on contact. A higher concentration of ethanol inflicts a very rapid coagulation of protein in the cell wall or membrane of target organism, effectively blocking further penetration of the organism and its subsequent neutralization. Because of this, a more diluted 70% concentration is used for optimal penetration.</p>

			<hr><h3><a id="Antibacterial_Stock_Preparation_starter_pack_40"></a>Antibacterial Stock Preparation (starter pack)</h3>
			<h4><a id="Introduction_41"></a>Introduction</h4>
			<p>The preparation of antibiotic stock is a relatively simple series of mixing and dilutions. The antibiotic stocks are typically made from four antibiotics: Ampicillin, Kanamycin, Tetracycline and Chloramphenicol. With the exception of chloramphenicol, the other antibiotics are light sensitive and once stock is prepared they are wrapped in foil to reduce light exposure.</p>
			<p>An antibiotic comes in a powder form as the basic stock and is mixed with milli-Q water to form a stock solution. Antibiotic stock preparation follows the same basic process for each antibiotic, varying only in concentration which is dependent on the type of antibiotic used.</p>
			<p>Antibiotic stocks are prepared for use either in liquid or solid media. In the case of liquid media, the antibiotic stock is simply added and mixed in. For solid media, usually agar and LB, the media is sent for autoclaving, and while the media is still hot the antibiotic is added and mixed. This is to ensure that the antibiotic can be mixed evenly amongst the media before it solidifies into a solid state.</p>
			<p>Antibiotics are used for the purpose of selection. In terms of synthetic biology, plasmids confer selective antibiotic resistance when successfully transformed into their target bacteria. Using liquid or solid growth media that has been treated with antibiotics provides a selection control for those bacteria that have successfully incorporated the plasmid.</p>
			<h5><a id="Basic_Terminology_and_Concepts_49"></a>Basic Terminology and Concepts</h5>
			<p>There are some terms which will be commonly used to describe the preparation of antibiotic stocks. Familiarity and understanding of these terms is key to comprehend the protocol.</p>
			<ul class='bullets'>
			<li><strong>Milli-Q</strong>: Water that has been purified through successive steps of filtration and deionization. The standard used in our lab is typically 18.2MΩ·cm at 25°C, measured in resistance due to the lack of ions. The filters used are 0.22μm in size to ensure a high level of purity. This water is used for preparing our antibacterial stock to ensure purity.</li>
			<li><strong>LB (Lysogeny Broth)</strong>: a very standard and simple media to create due to its recipe consisting of 3 components - tryptone, yeast extract, and sodium chloride. This mix of anhydrous ingredients is added to water and then autoclaved, producing liquid media. The production of solid LB for plates is done by adding agar, a protein isolated from certain species of seaweed which coagulates the liquid into a gel-like form when cooled. This is done prior to autoclaving and is poured into the plates while still hot, where it will cool into the plate shape.</li>
			<li><strong>Aliquot</strong>: An aliquot is a term to denote a certain quantity of something. In this case an aliquot of antibiotic stock would denote either 1mL or 0.5mL, depending on the antibiotic.</li>
			<li><strong>Antibiotic</strong>: Compounds which inhibit bacterial growth. They act either bacteriostatically by preventing reproduction of the bacteria, or bacteriocidally where they directly kill the bacteria. Generally bacteriocides work by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan in the bacteria’s cell walls. Tetracycline is an example of a bacteriostatic, where it acts by binding to the ribosomes of prokaryotic bacteria and inhibits translation.</li>
			<li><strong>Autoclave</strong>: A piece of equipment used for sterilization. The autoclave performs much like a pressure cooker: it subjects the contents inside it to a high temperature and high pressure steam bath. Usually the temperature is 121°C and at 15lbs/in<sup>2</sup>, 20 minutes is enough to kill most microorganisms and render equipment sterile. When adding antibiotics to media, it is done after autoclaving so that the heat does not destroy the antibiotic activity.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4><a id="Safety_precautions_57"></a>Safety precautions</h4>
			<p><strong>SDS (safety data sheet)</strong>: Refer to the SDS sheets for all listed materials before entering the lab. Be prepared to answer any questions regarding th3e information on these sheets.</p>
			<p><strong>PPE (Personal protective equipment)</strong>: Proper lab attire should be worn throughout the experiment: This means that upon entering the lab you should be wearing long pants and close-toed shoes. Contact lenses should not be worn. Furthermore, a lab coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn at all times, and long hair should be tied back.</p>

			<p>In order for bacteria to be successfully cultured, they must be grown in the appropriate media. LB, also known as Lysogeny broth, is a nutrient rich broth that is a standard for culturing Escherichia coli, as it allows for quick growth and high yields. Therefore, the proper preparation of LB will be crucial to maintaining our bacterial stock throughout the summer. Furthermore, addition of agar to LB broth creates a gel for bacteria to grow upon, and is therefore used for plating bacterial cultures on petri dishes.</p>

			<h5><a id="Part_1_Making_the_LB_broth_289"></a>Part 1: Making the LB broth</h5>
			<p>This part can be carried out at a regular lab bench.</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Obtain a clean 1L pyrex bottle</li>
			<li>Obtain a graduated cylinder with 500mL of dH<sub>2</sub>O and add to the bottle. Record the amount added.</li>
			<li>Using filter paper, separately measure out 5g of NaCl, 5g of Tryptone, and 2.5g of yeast extract on a scale and add them to the bottle. Swirl the bottle in a circular motion to mix. Remember to recalibrate your scales in between measurements.</li>
			<li>If you are making LB agar plates, weigh and add 7.5g of agar and swirl to mix. Record the amount added.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Note the contents do not necessarily need to be completely in solution before autoclaving.</p>
			<h5><a id="Part_2_Autoclaving_298"></a>Part 2: Autoclaving</h5>
			<ol>
			<li>Lightly seal the top of the beaker with aluminium foil, and label the beaker with autoclave tape stating LB (agar)–[your name]–[date]–[media number]–iGEM.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Unless you have been trained to use the autoclave, you will not be conducting the following steps in this part</strong></p>
			<ol start="2">
			<li>Use appropriate transportation protocols to bring the LB bottle into the autoclave room. Remember to store the beaker in an autoclavable basin, in case of spills.</li>
			<li>Check the water level on the autoclave, if necessary. Autoclave on the liquid setting for approximately 20 min.</li>
			</ol>
			<ul class='bullets'>
			<li>The contents of the beaker will be hot after autoclaving, therefore take the necessary measures to prevent burns.</li>
			</ul>
			<ol start="4">
			<li>After autoclaving, allow the LB media to cool to 55°C before handling.
			<ul class='bullets'>
			<li>Use laser thermometer to check the temperature of the glass.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The LB broth can be stored in sterile conditions at room temperature, and should be good for 3-4 months. Flame the lip of the bottle each time the LB is used. If the LB contains antibiotics, store in a -4°C freezer.
			<ul class='bullets'>
			<li>However, it is not recommended to store LB with antibiotics as the antibiotics will degrade over time</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ol>
			<h5><a id="Part_3_Pouring_the_plates_for_LB_agar_310"></a>Part 3: Pouring the plates (for LB agar)</h5>
			<p>While pouring the plates, it is crucial to maintain a sterile environment. This should be done in room WB 303, with a sterile environment provided by a lit Bunsen burner.</p>
			<p><em>Note: steps 1-3, in addition to the clean up from Part 1, can be done while waiting for autoclave.</em></p>
			<ol>
			<li>Sterilize the workspace with 70% EtOH before depositing your materials. Light the Bunsen burner.</li>
			<li>Obtain a stack/roll of empty plates. The plates should still be in their plastic sleeve/wrapping, as they should be sterile. Don’t throw out the wrapping as it can be used to store the plates. It is essential that you minimize any chance of contaminating the plates. Make sure that you open the package at the top and expose the plates as minimally as possible.
			<ul class='bullets'>
			<li><em>Note that this protocol makes ~25 plates.</em></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Once you take the plates out, store them upside down on your lab bench. Label the plates with [your name]–iGEM 2017–[date]–[media number]–[antibiotic stripe]. Once labelled, you may stack the plates to free up workspace.
			<ul class='bullets'>
			<li>One stripe along the sides corresponds to CAM, two stripes corresponds to AMP</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Allow the LB media to cool before pouring. The LB will start to settle at ~30°C.</li>
			<li>If you are preparing selective media, add antibiotic to the mixture. Swirl the flask in a circular motion to mix. If you don’t know whether or not you are preparing selective media, ASK.
			<ul class='bullets'>
			<li>Use concentrated liquid stocks for the antibiotics.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ol>
			<ul class='bullets'>
			<li>Recommenced antibiotic concentrations:
			<ul class='bullets'>
			<li>Chloramphenicol (CAM): 25μg/mL</li>
			<li>Ampicillin (AMP): 100μg/mL</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<ol start="6">
			<li>Take an empty plate and open it slightly. You do not need to open it all the way to pour the agar.</li>
			<li>Pour agar until 2/3 of the plate has been covered, or approximately half of the plate has been filled when viewed from the side. Pour the agar slowly to prevent the formation of bubbles. Swirl the plate in a circular motion to distribute the media evenly on the plate.</li>
			</ol>
			<ul class='bullets'>
			<li>If you pour too much LB, you will not be able to produce 25 plates. If you don’t pour enough media, it may minimize bacterial growth.</li>
			</ul>
			<ol start="8">
			<li>After pouring, set the plates to cool in stacks of 4-5 to save space and flip the plates to prevent condensation forming on the agar. Don’t stack plates too high - we want to minimize the risk of spills. Allow the plates to cool for at least 20 minutes until the agar has solidified.</li>
			<li>Rinse the Pyrex bottle with water before the remnants solidify and become hard to remove.</li>
			<li>The plates can then be stacked and stored in plastic bags (ideally, re-use the plastic bags that the plates came in.)</li>
			<li>Store LB agar plates in a 4°C freezer. They should be good for 1-2 months.</li>
			</ol>

			<hr><h3><a id="SOC_Medium_Protocol_starter_pack_345"></a>SOC Medium Protocol (starter pack)</h3>
			<h4><a id="Introduction_346"></a>Introduction</h4>
			<p>SOC is a variant of the rich media SOB (super optimal broth) with catabolite repression. This means that glucose is supplemented in the media, allowing for optimal metabolic conditions for the bacteria. SOC increases the transformation efficiency of cells, as it provides ample nutrients to cells that have recently undergone stress as result of having been made competent. Accordingly, it will be used in bacterial transformation to stabilize the cells and to increase transformation yields. Since SOC is high in nutrients, it is more easily contaminated than LB or King’s B media.</p>

			<p><strong>Mg<sup>2+</sup> and additives</strong>: Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration of 2.0mM is optimal for most PCR products generated with Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase. When used at a final concentration of 1X, the Q5 Reaction Buffer provides the optimal Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration.</p>
			<p><strong>Deoxynucleotides</strong>: The final concentration of dNTPs is typically 200μM of each deoxynucleotide. Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase cannot incorporate dUTP and is not recommended for use with uracil-containing primers or templates.</p>
			<p><strong>Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase concentration</strong>: We generally recommend using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase at a final concentration of 20units/mL (1.0 units/50μL reaction). However, the optimal concentration of Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase may vary from 10–40 units/mL (0.5–2 units/50 μL reaction) depending on amplicon length and difficulty. Do not exceed 2 units/50 μL reaction, especially for amplicons longer than 5 kb.</p>
			<p><strong>Buffers</strong>: The 5X Q5 Reaction Buffer provided with the enzyme is recommended as the first-choice buffer for robust, high-fidelity amplification. The 5X Q5 Reaction Buffer is detergent-free and contains 2.0 mM Mg++ at the final (1X) concentration.</p>
			<ul class='bullets'>
			<li>Amplification of some difficult targets, like GC-rich sequences or secondary structures, may be improved by the addition of 1X Q5 High GC Enhancer. The Q5 High GC Enhancer is not a buffer and should not be used alone. It should be added only to reactions with the Q5 Reaction Buffer when other conditions have failed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Denaturation</strong>: An initial denaturation of 30 seconds at 98°C is sufficient for most amplicons from pure DNA templates. Longer denaturation times can be used (up to 3 minutes) for templates that require it.</p>
			<ul class='bullets'>
			<li>During thermocycling, the denaturation step should be kept to a minimum. Typically, a 5–10 second denaturation at 98°C is recommended for most templates.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Annealing</strong>: Optimal annealing temperatures for Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase tend to be higher than for other PCR polymerases. The <a href="https://www.neb.com/tools-and-resources/interactive-tools/tm-calculator_">NEB T<sub>m</sub> Calculator</a> should be used to determine the annealing temperature when using this enzyme. Typically, use a 10–30 second annealing step at 3°C above the T<sub>m</sub> of the lower T<sub>m</sub> primer. A temperature gradient can also be used to optimize the annealing temperature for each primer pair.</p>
			<ul class='bullets'>
			<li>For high Tm primer pairs, two-step cycling without a separate annealing step can be used.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Extension</strong>: The recommended extension temperature is 72°C. Extension times are generally 20–30 seconds per kb for complex, genomic samples, but can be reduced to 10 seconds per kb for simple templates (plasmid, <em>E. coli</em>, etc.) or complex templates < 1 kb. Extension time can be increased to 40 seconds per kb for cDNA or long, complex templates, if necessary.</p>
			<ul class='bullets'>
			<li>A final extension of 2 minutes at 72°C is recommended.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Cycle number</strong>: Generally, 25–35 cycles yield sufficient product. For genomic amplicons, 30-35 cycles are recommended.</p>
			<p><strong>2-step PCR</strong>: When primers with annealing temperatures ≥ 72°C are used, a 2-step thermocycling protocol (combining annealing and extension into one step) is possible.</p>
			<p><strong>Amplification of long products</strong>: When amplifying products > 6 kb, it is often helpful to increase the extension time to 40–50 seconds/kb.</p>
			<p><strong>PCR product</strong>: The PCR products generated using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase have blunt ends. If cloning is the next step, then blunt-end cloning is recommended. If T/A-cloning is preferred, the DNA should be purified prior to A-addition, as Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase will degrade any overhangs generated.</p>
			<h5><a id="Additives_567"></a>Additives:</h5>
			<p><strong>DMSO</strong>: Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an organosulfur compound with a high polarity and high dielectric constant used in PCR to disrupt secondary structure formation in the DNA template. DMSO is believed to hydrogen bond to the major and minor grooves of template DNA, and as a result destabilizes the double helix structure. This is particularly useful in templates with high GC content because the increased hydrogen bond strength increases the difficulty of denaturing the template and causes intermolecular secondary structures to form more readily, which can compete with primer annealing. Thus, the addition of DMSO can greatly improve yields and specificities of PCR priming reactions, test a variety of DMSO concentrations between 2-10%</p>
			<p><strong>Glycerol</strong>: Similarly reduces secondary structure. Use 5-10%.</p>
			<p><strong>Formamide</strong>: Formamide is a widely used organic PCR additive. Formamide is thought to work by binding in the major and minor grooves of DNA, destabilizing the template double-helix and lower melting temperature. Formamide is usually used at 1-5%.</p>

			<p><strong>SDS (safety data sheet)</strong>: Refer to the SDS sheets for all listed materials before entering the lab. Be prepared to answer any questions regarding the information on these sheets.</p>
			<p><strong>PPE (Personal protective equipment)</strong>: Proper lab attire should be worn throughout the experiment. This means that upon entering the lab you should be wearing long pants and close-toed shoes. Contact lenses should not be worn. Furthermore, a lab coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn at all times, and long hair should be tied back.</p>

			<p>EZ-10 spin column purification kits use a silica-gel membrane that selectively absorbs up to 10μg of DNA fragments in the presence of specialized binding buffers. Nucleotides, oligos (< 40-mer), enzymes, mineral oil, and other impurities do not bind to the membrane and are washed away. The DNA fragments can then be eluted off the column in small volume and used in downstream applications without further processing.</p>

			<h4><a id="Introduction_766"></a>Introduction</h4>
			<p>In this protocol, you will be using chemically competent <em>E. coli</em> that have been placed in a calcium chloride solution prior to freezing. The solution acts to neutralize the cells so that they don’t repel each other. The bacteria and plasmid mixture will be chilled on ice for 30 minutes. Placing the mixture in a 42°C water bath for 30 seconds will heat shock the mixture, which will cause the transformation. Once the LB is added and mixed with the transformed bacteria, it can be plated on the LB plate with an antibiotic. Since much of the bacteria will not be transformed after the heat shock, plating <em>E. coli</em> with an antibiotic will ensure that only transformed <em>E. coli</em> survive.</p>
			<p>Before doing this protocol, please watch this video: <a href="https://vimeo.com/25201947">https://vimeo.com/25201947</a>. Note that we do not have a control for our experiment, and we are not using a thermomixer.</p>

			<li>Note that the TAE buffer in the stock has 50X concentration and needs to be diluted with autoclaved Milli-Q water.</li>
			</ul>
			<ol start="2">
			<li>Place the flask into the microwave. <strong>After this step flask will be hot. Use heat gloves</strong>.</li>
			<li>Set the timer to 2 min. Start the microwave oven but stop every 30 sec to swirl the contents of the flask. This helps suspend the undissolved agarose. Continue until agarose particles are dissolved.</li>
			<li>While hot, add 3µl of 10,000X SYBR Safe into the agarose solution and mix throughly.</li>
			<li>Set the flask aside for cooling. Occasionally swirl to make the cooling even.</li>

			<hr><h3><a id="Transformation_Efficiency_Confirmation_1232"></a>Transformation Efficiency (Confirmation)</h3>
			<h4><a id="Introduction_1233"></a>Introduction</h4>
			<p>Transformation efficiency is the efficiency by which bacterial cells take up foreign DNA and express the genes encoded by it. Since in reality only a small portion of competent cells are transformed, a reasonable representation of transformation efficiency is calculated by dividing successful transformants by the amount of DNA used during transformation procedure, in CFU/μg of DNA. By verifying the transformation efficiency value against that of standard competent <em>E.coli</em> cells (1.5x10<sup>8</sup> to 6x10<sup>8</sup> cfu/μg DNA), competency of electroporated sample can be validated. The transformation efficiency kit from iGEM includes five vials of purified DNA from BBa_J04450 (RFP construct) in plasmid backbone pSB1C3. Each vial contains DNA at a different concentration: 50pg/ul, 20pg/ul, 10pg/ul, 5pg/ul, 0.5pg/ul. The transformation efficiency test is performed with each concentration of DNA in parallel.</p>

			</ol>
			<ul class='bullets'>
			<li>Note: There should be 50μL of DNA in each tube sent in the Kit.</li>
			</ul>
			<ol start="2">
			<li>Thaw competent cells on ice. Label one 2.0mL microcentrifuge tube for each concentration and then pre-chill by placing the tubes on ice.</li>
			<li>Pipette 1μL of DNA into each microcentrifuge tube. There will be 5 microcentrifuges that contain 1μL of DNA of different concentration.</li>
			<li>Pipette 50μL of competent cells into each tube. Flick the tube gently with your finger to mix. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes. Pre-heat waterbath so that thermometer reads 42°C.</li>
			<li>Heat-shock the cells by placing into the waterbath for 1 minute. Be careful to keep the lids of the tubes above the water level, and keep the ice close by.</li>
			<li>Immediately transfer the tubes back to ice, and incubate on ice for 5 minutes. This helps the cells recover.</li>
			<li>Add 200μL of SOC media per tube, and incubate at 37°C for 2 hours. Prepare the agar plates during this time, also label them with concentration of DNA used.</li>
			<li>Pipette 20μL from each tube onto the appropriate plate, and spread the mixture evenly across the plate with spreader. Incubate at 37°C overnight or approximately 16 hours. Position the plates so the agar side is facing up, and the lid is facing down.</li>
			<li>Count the number of colonies on a light field or a dark background, such as a lab bench. Use the following equation to calculate your competent cell efficiency.</li>
			</ol>
